* Creating a web server from scratch using Go.

1. Create a project
   + Inside golang/src/github.com/zenathark
   + Create .gitignore, README.md, LICENCE.md
   + Create /projectname/.go and /projectname/_test.go
   + Create a main.go if it is an executable (?)

2. Creating a tokenizer
   Using https://www.schoolofhaskell.com/school/starting-with-haskell/basics-of-haskell/6-tokenizer-function-types
   that has tokenizer instructions in haskell, I will write the tokenizer. This
   is needed because the HTTP standard is defined in terms of BFS. Note that I
   may not end up writing idiomatic Go.

   1. Enumerate tokens. Create an enumeration of possible tokens.
   2. Declare Token Types: With value and only by type.
   3. Creating a token structure. A token structure will have an id or an id and a value.
   4. Create constructors for the data types.
   5. Test!
